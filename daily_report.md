# Style Guide

## Subject

In format of *[{project_name} Daily Report]* , no need to put your name or date in the subject.

## Content

In this format:

```
Today:

- Item1
- Item2
- Item3

Next Day:

- Item1
- Item2
- Item3
```

- **The content should be well organized, not too concise nor too verbose.** The purpose of daily report is to report your progress to your leader, including coding and researching, so your leader can act accordingly. Think of this purpose before you send it out.
- Use present tense with verbs, no need of *I will* or *I did* .
- Pay attention to writing, including spelling and punctuations.

A bad example, this is useless:

```
Today:

- Fix some bugs.

Next Day:

- Fix more bugs.
```

A good example:

```
Today:

- Draft db schema of xxx and xxx, see doc.
- Fix bug #11: xxx, #14: xxx.
- Fail to fix bug #12: xxx, don't know what's wrong, please help.
- Implement story #3: xxx, 70 percent done.
- Read book xxx chapter xxx, now I understand xxx.

Next Day:

- Draft db schema of xxx and xxx.
- Continue to fix bug #12: xxx.
- Finish story #3: xxx.
- Research xxx.
```

NOTE: the `doc` and `#11`, `#14`, `#12`, `#3` are links, when you mention something, if they have external related resources, better to link them. On the contrast, just write *Fix bug #11* is not friendly, you're forcing your leader to manually navigate, which is a wast of time.
